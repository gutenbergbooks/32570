<p>The economic value of the fast transportation of passengers, mail
and express matter has been well proven. The existing high speed
railway trains and ocean liners are the result of the ever increasing
demand for rapid communication both on land and water.</p>

<p>Saving in time is the great essential. The maximum surface
speed has apparently been attained. The railways and steamships of
today, while indeed fast, have reached their economical limit of speed
and it is not to be expected that they will be able, because of the enormous
additional cost of operation involved, to attain much greater
speeds.</p>

<p>The large Zeppelin Airship supplies the demand for a much faster,
more luxurious, more comfortable and more safe long distance transportation.
It is not restricted by the geographical limitations of the
railway and the steamship. <i>A Zeppelin can go anywhere</i>, in fact the
cruising radius of a Zeppelin is only limited by the size of the ship and
the amount of fuel it can carry.</p>

<p>Zeppelins, only slightly larger than those actually flown during the
last few months of the war, are capable of safely and quickly making a
non-stop flight from Berlin to Chicago and from New York to Paris
in 56 hours, carrying 100 passengers and in addition 12 tons of mail or
express matter.</p>

<p>In November, 1917, the Zeppelin L-59 made a non-stop flight
from Jambol, Bulgaria, to a point just west of Khartum in Africa and
return to Jambol in 95 hours (4 days) covering a distance of 4225 miles
and carrying more than 14 tons of freight besides a crew of 22, which
performance remains a world’s record for all kinds of aircraft, airship or
aeroplane.</p>

<p>In July, 1919, the British Rigid Airship R-34 (copy of the Zeppelin
L-33 brought down in England) crossed the Atlantic in 103 hours and
after being refueled at New York returned home in 75 hours.</p>

<p>The German Airship Transportation Company—DELAG—(a
Zeppelin subsidiary) during a period of three years just before the war,
1911-14, carried 34,228 passengers without a single injury to either
passengers or crews, and after the war, from August 24th to December
1st, 1919, by means of the improved Zeppelin “Bodensee” carried 2,380
passengers, 11,000 pounds of mail (440,000 letters), and 6,600 pounds of
express matter, exclusive of crews, between Friedrichshafen (Swiss
frontier) and Berlin under unfavorable weather and terminal conditions,
besides a flight from Berlin to Stockholm and return.</p>

<p>The U.&nbsp;S. Government has concluded arrangements (June, 1922)
with the Allied Powers whereby the U.&nbsp;S. Navy will receive a modern
Zeppelin as a part of America’s share of the aerial reparations.</p>

<p>This new Zeppelin will embody the very latest improvements in
airship design and will be delivered by being flown from Berlin across
the Atlantic to the Navy’s Airship Harbor at Lakehurst, New Jersey.
It will be built by Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin (Zeppelin Airship Building
Co., Ltd.), at their Friedrichshafen Works and will be a 70,000 cubic
meter (2,400,000 cu. ft.) gas capacity commercial type, as it is intended
that it will be flown in the United States to demonstrate the safety and
practicability of long distance airship-transport. It will be delivered
by a Zeppelin crew. The arrival in the United States of this strictly
modern Zeppelin will no doubt create a wonderful interest as the American
people have never seen a real Zeppelin and it will give a great
impetus to airship activities throughout the world.</p>

<p>The U.&nbsp;S. Navy are building at Lakehurst, N.&nbsp;J., the ZR-1 modeled
after the Zeppelin L-49. The ZR-1 will be of 55,000 cubic meters
(1,940,000 cu. ft.) gas capacity and is intended for use as an experimental
and training ship.</p>

<p>Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin is building (August, 1922) at Friedrichshafen
a Zeppelin of 30,000 cubic meters (1,059,000 cu. ft.) gas capacity
to be used for experimental and training purposes. It will be finished
in the winter of 1922-23 and in time to take advantage of some of the
worst of winter weather conditions for experiments having to do with
airship navigation under the extremes of weather and temperature.</p>

<h3>Zeppelin and His Airships</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">C</span>ount</span> Ferdinand von Zeppelin was born at Constance on
Lake Constance (Bodensee), Germany, July 8th, 1838. His
boyhood was not unlike that of others in Central Europe;
and, as a matter of course, young Zeppelin was enrolled at a military
school at Ludwigsburg, from which he in due time graduated into a
lieutenancy in the Wurttemberg Army, but he was not particularly
enthralled with the quiet life of a garrison in peace time. His
creative faculties demanded something more of life than the routine
of inspections, drills and dress parades. When he died on March 8,
1917, in Berlin, the whole world mourned the loss of one whose
genius and vision had developed the rigid airship into a practical
vehicle of the sky, proved of inestimable value in peace and war.
Zeppelin had lived to see <i>more than a hundred rigid airships built</i>
from his designs and under his personal supervision. And so completely
was his personality interwoven with the creation of these
aerial giants that throughout the world all dirigible lighter-than-air
craft are looked upon as the noted Zeppelins, and are referred to as
such. It is an unconscious but none the less fitting tribute to the
man who, starting when he was past the half century mark, has
made possible the greatest of all vehicles for us to use in our new
dominion—the air.</p>

<p>Here in America the Civil War was attracting the adventurous
from all parts of the world and shortly after it started, Zeppelin
came over to join the Union Army as a volunteer officer and thus to
add to his military education, but Zeppelin was not only the officer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
He loved to roam in out of the way places and whenever opportunity
afforded he organized hunting parties and went off on long sojourns
in the then sparsely inhabited regions of the Mississippi Valley.
Here he played the explorer and wrote letters back home dwelling
on the pleasures of exploration and the possibilities in store for him
who could invent something that would take one to the far and
inaccessible parts of the earth.</p>


<h3>Zeppelin’s First Rigid Design</h3>

<p>His impressions gained during the American Civil War, where he
had the opportunity of making captive balloon ascensions, and also
in the Franco-German War where he had the opportunity of watching
the numerous balloons leaving Paris during the siege, no doubt,
first originated in Zeppelin’s mind the thought of developing a large
rigid airship. In fact, as early as 1873 he designed a large rigid
airship, sub-divided into single compartments and he emphasized
the importance of such aircraft for long distance transportation in
order to help in the civilization of mankind.</p>

<p>In 1887 Zeppelin submitted a memorandum to the King of
Wurttemberg in which he explained in detail the requirements of a
really successful airship and stated many reasons why such airships
ought to be large and of rigid construction. However, nothing of
importance was actually accomplished until he resigned as a General
in 1891 in order to give his full time to his invention.</p>

<p class="caption">Count Zeppelin’s Second Floating Shed With Zeppelin “LZ-5”.

<p>In 1894 at the age of 56 years, with the assistance of an Engineer,
Kober, he had completed the design of a rigid airship, and the modern
rigid airship of today is not essentially different from Zeppelin’s
first design. He submitted these designs to a special committee
that had been appointed by the most famous of the German scientific
authorities and was greatly disappointed over the decision of the
committee which, although they could not find any essential faults<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in the Count’s design, could not recommend that an airship be built
in accordance with Zeppelin’s plans. Admitting that he was not the
first to conceive the idea of rigid airships, Count Zeppelin, however,
insisted that he had arrived at new principles and that these principles
were sound. There had been several attempts to build rigids,
but there always had been too much weight of the necessarily voluminous
framework, which so anchored the craft with its own weight
that it could not lift itself. The discovery of aluminum made this
problem less difficult, however, and many models were designed with
the framework of this light material.</p>

<p>Two years after Count Zeppelin had completed his first designs
and while he was still endeavoring to arouse enough interest to
warrant the construction of a rigid ship, an aluminum framework
rigid ship was built by another group near Berlin. This ship was of
approximately 150 feet in length, but of an essentially different
design from Zeppelin’s. The outer cover was made of metal. On
its first trial flight it was compelled to land, due to engine trouble
and the fact that the framework of the ship was not strong enough to
stand the stresses of the landing, caused it to go to pieces and this
failure was quickly seized upon by the then existing adversaries of
the rigid airship as an argument against the construction of rigid
airships with a metal framework. This was unfortunate to the
cause of rigid airships, because while Zeppelin had not been identified
with that attempt, all experimenters were included in the popular
condemnation.</p>

<p>Zeppelin’s improvements were beginning to be recognized and
admitted, but the money necessary for the development was not
forthcoming.</p>

</div>

<p>Zeppelin, in spite of many difficulties, succeeded in enlisting the
necessary private capital and in 1898 organized a stock company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
(Aktiengesellschaft zur Foerderung der Motorluftschiffahrt) to promote
motor airship flights. It had a paid in capital of one million
marks ($238,000).</p>

<p>With his characteristic sound judgment and thoroughness of
purpose, Count Zeppelin chose the Lake Constance (Bodensee)
country for his initial efforts. He had known the lake and local
weather conditions from boyhood and was convinced that the smooth
ample surface of this beautiful lake offered the best facilities for the
handling, starting and landing of these extremely large craft, though
it was not long before enough had been learned to alight with them
on land.</p>

<p>Now the giant Zeppelins can land at will with perfect safety on
either land or water.</p>

<p>Today Lake Constance is recognized as the best place in the
world for the training of airship personnel.</p>

<p>The eyes of the entire aeronautical world were focused on the
floating airship shed (<a href="#PLATE_1">Plate 1</a>), which Count Zeppelin built and
anchored in a bay close to his workshops at Manzell, near Friedrichshafen.
During the months that he was making the parts in
the shop and assembling his ship in the shed, there was much speculation
as to its appearance. It was generally thought by others who
had experimented with aircraft that Zeppelin had some very laudable
ideas, but as a rule persons were skeptical concerning his ability
to produce a practical machine. Interest increased and when he
announced that he would fly on July 2nd, 1900, all those interested
in aeronautics, who could make the trip, came to Friedrichshafen
and for several days before the flight delivered professional opinions
predicting failure.</p>

<p>They solemnly averred that the airship would bend with the
weight of the gondolas under its ends. They said if it bent, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
engines and steering apparatus would not function. Further, they
feared the ship would keel over in mid-air because, and they backed
this assumption with figures and formulas based on their professional
engineering knowledge and technique, as they pointed out, the center
of gravity was too high. Then again the motors would surely
explode the ship because the gondolas which held them were too
close to the body. All expected Zeppelin to fail, and they were on
hand as witnesses when first the big cigar shaped bag was floated out
of its shed (<a href="#PLATE_1">Plate 1</a>).</p>

<p>It was a huge thing in those days, 419.8 feet long (128 meters),
with a diameter of 38.3 feet (11.7 meters). It was made up of an
immense aluminum framework including 24 longitudinal girders
running from nose to tail and drawn together at the ends. Joining
the girders were 16 rings, (reinforced with diagonal wires), formed of
transverse girders, which held the body together. On the bottom
side of the body was fixed a bridge-like construction which strengthened
the framework sideways and attached to it were two motor
gondolas.</p>

<p>Over this vast framework Zeppelin had stretched an envelope of
smooth cotton cloth, to lessen the friction through the air and to
protect the gas bags from the direct rays of the sun. There were 16
single gas cells made of rubberized balloon cloth placed inside the
framework. All were equipped with safety valves and several were
provided with maneuvering valves. All together they contained
388,410 cubic feet (11,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen gas, which
Zeppelin was confident would lift 24,450 pounds (12,000 kilograms).</p>

<p>Immediately after the ship had been floated from the hangar
Zeppelin permitted it to rise off the pontoons on which it had rested
and the first successful rigid airship flight was an accomplished fact.
He nosed his craft up through the air, the two 16 horsepower motors
sending it along slowly at 13.5 miles per hour (6 meters per second).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Notwithstanding this low speed the craft responded to the controls
and Zeppelin a few minutes later demonstrated that he could alight
safely as well as take off.</p>


<h3>The First Company Dissolved Through Lack of Funds</h3>

<p>Zeppelin made three flights with his first airship, on the third
making 17.8 miles per hour (8 meters per second) but the funds had
become exhausted and overtures to the Government and industrial
concerns failing, he dissolved the stock company and began anew
his struggle for capital. Somehow or other people were not interested
in aerial navigation. They were less willing to invest their
resources in experimental machines. For five years Zeppelin labored
tirelessly to make persons believe in his project. He personally
traveled the length and breadth of the land endeavoring to show that
this was an enterprise so stupendous in its possibilities and importance
to the world that it should be substantially endorsed.</p>


<h3>Assisted by the King of Wurttemberg</h3>

<p>It was not until 1905 that King William of Wurttemberg having
supplied the funds and an aluminum manufacturer having lent him
sufficient material for another frame that Zeppelin, now 67 years old,
was able to start work on his second rigid airship. He completed
it that fall after working incessantly day and night, making important
changes over the first design, strengthening and at the same time
lightening the framework and adding considerably to the efficiency
of the steering apparatus. Motors also had been developing during
that period and he was able to find two 85 horsepower motors for his
power plants.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p class="caption" style="width: 95%">Zeppelin “L-2”. Interior View showing Internal Corridor Construction.<br />

<p>And then, as the ship was being taken out of the hangar the first
time, the forward steering gear broken, and the craft was literally
driven by the wind the entire length of Lake Constance, not stopping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
till it was brought up against the Swiss shore, whence with much
difficulty it was returned to the workshops and repaired.</p>

<p>The next time he flew, Zeppelin took the ship to a height of 1640
feet (500 meters) over the lake before motor trouble developed and he
was forced to land at Allgau. Though he had no assistance aside
from his crew and had made no preparations the inventor was
successful in landing; and he moored her there in an open field for
the night while repairing the motors. Before they could be started
again a winter storm swept against the craft and it was so badly
damaged that Count Zeppelin with a heavy heart was forced to give
orders to dismantle it.</p>


<h3>Handicapped by Motor Trouble</h3>

<p>There was world-wide comment over the accident which was not
due to structural defect or design. Zeppelin explained that he could
have survived the storm had he been able to keep his motors running.
But everybody thought his dream was shattered, one more glorious
failure. But Zeppelin did not agree with public sentiment. The
following April he commenced his third ship, throwing into the
venture his last resources along with all the enthusiasm and confidence
of youth. It was this that enabled him to announce its completion
in October 1906. It was exactly like the one destroyed at
Allgau except for the stabilizers at the stern which had been added
to permit of smooth flying (<a href="#PLATE_2">Plate 2</a>).</p>


<h3>Successful Trials with the Third Zeppelin</h3>

<p>Experiments with this craft were immediately successful. Zeppelin
guided it over the lake between three and four hours in a single
flight, making wide circles and maneuvering under absolute control,
remarkable in view of its size. The ship also showed superior speed,
making 28.8 miles per hour (13 meters per second).</p>

<p>This ship brought Zeppelin and his assistants their first public<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
recognition. The German Government offered the inventor a new
floating shed (<a href="#PLATE_3">Plate 3</a>), larger than the old one, which would enable
him to improve his craft and enlarge them. To him this was the
most essential. He more than any other apparently realized that
he must increase their size to develop practical weight lifting capacity.</p>


<h3>The Government Becomes Interested</h3>

<p>Meanwhile he continued his demonstration flights with his third
ship, culminating on October 1st, 1907, in a brilliant 8 hour flight of
more than 218.5 miles (350 kilometers). Thereupon the Government
officials declared their willingness to take over Count Zeppelin’s
ships if they fulfilled certain requirements, among them a twenty-four
hour flight. Early the next summer Zeppelin took out another new
ship, LZ-4 (<a href="#PLATE_3">Plate 3</a>), somewhat larger than its predecessors, holding
529,650 cubic feet (15,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen. This increased
size gave it a carrying capacity of 37,478 pounds (17,000 kilograms)
which, with increased motor power—each engine estimated at approximately
100 horsepower—made it a practical weight carrying
and speedy craft. Count Zeppelin with an eye to the passenger and
military possibilities had also built into the forward part of the hull,
on top, an observation platform. It marked the beginning of refinement
in design and conveniences which has been continued unceasingly.
Here was an airship which Zeppelin felt worthy of demonstrating
to the public at large.</p>


<h3>Zeppelins for Commerce and War</h3>

<p>His great flight on July 1st, 1908, was as successful as it surely
was daring for he took the new rigid up over the Swiss Alps to Lucerne
and back again.</p>

<p class="caption">Zeppelin “L-30” Naval Airship, 1916.</p></div>

<p>The world was astounded, particularly his contemporaries, a
majority of whom unhesitatingly flooded the grand old man with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
enthusiastic messages of congratulation. Just as he had worked so
devotedly to bringing forth something in which the German people
could have faith, so was his faith justified. The public was wildly
enthusiastic. Everybody was proud of the accomplishment on
German soil and joyfully acclaimed Zeppelin whose lone ideas were
now the ideas of a nation. His triumph was not only official but
national. His vision was the vision of the people and it was an
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>Rarely had there been such national interest shown in any sort of
venture as that represented by the vast throngs that gathered from
all parts of the empire to witness the start of the official duration
flight on August 4th that year. Zeppelin planned to sail the ship
down the Rhine Valley toward Mainz and return. He got away on
schedule and disappeared in the soft haze, all Germany receiving
reports of his progress as the ship appeared for a few moments over a
village and then out of sight once more.</p>

<p>But disaster awaited the gallant ship. On the return flight motor
trouble caused a forced landing at Echterdingen near Stuttgart. A
storm blew up and the airship was torn from its moorings. As it was
being whirled into the air, the entire structure was suddenly enveloped
in a solid flame and Zeppelin a few moments later was gazing
at the twisted skeleton of his latest efforts.</p>

<p>It was thought then that Zeppelin had built his last airship. He
had employed all his own personal resources in that venture, and
though the rigid had performed remarkably, even his closest friends
could see nothing but failure in further attempts to establish the new
science. But they were wrong. Zeppelin had been more successful
than he realized. His persistent efforts had continuously improved
the rigid type. Each flight was better and more efficient than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
ones preceding it. All this had been noted by the people. When it
was learned that Count Zeppelin had no funds with which to continue,
a popular subscription campaign was started in various sections,
with the result that within a few weeks 6,000,000 marks (approximately
$1,500,000) had been contributed and turned over to
Zeppelin for him to use as he saw fit in carrying on his experiments.
Here indeed was recognition. For the money had come from persons
of high and low degree, from huts and palaces. The Zeppelin fund
was truly representative of the people. It made the shops and
hangar on Lake Constance a popular institution. For the first time
in his life the inventor found his airship enterprise on a firm financial
basis. With this foundation he was able to increase his shop and
laboratory facilities and make important changes in his organization.
Instead of being forced to produce something for demonstration
flights alone, he was able to concentrate on practical development.
His personnel was ably qualified for the new work. Many of his
assistants had been with him since the beginning. His progress had
been theirs in the new science of lighter-than-air engineering. Many
of these men are still with the Zeppelin organization which retains
the original name created by the popular support of the German
people.</p>


<h3>The Beginning of the Zeppelin Organization</h3>

<p>With the 6,000,000 marks presented to him Count Zeppelin
founded the “Zeppelinstiftung zur Foerderung der Luftfahrt” (Zeppelin
Endowment for the Propagation of Air Navigation). This
organization is the exclusive shareholder of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin
(the constructing company), and through this controls the many
subsidiary companies, each one producing essential parts of the
Zeppelin so that the entire organization is practically independent of
outside sources. The various organizations have been added to and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
developed at intervals since the Zeppelin Endowment was created in
1908. They are not only concerned with producing airships and all
their parts but with developing airplanes, seaplanes and power plants,
with the special machinery so important to the success of the new
aircraft which Zeppelin continuously produced and which proved
superior to other products, due in no small part to the splendid
organization developed by means of the popular fund, the profits
from which under the terms by which Count Zeppelin accepted it,
must continuously be thrown back into the treasury “to be used
exclusively for the propagation and development of air navigation.”</p>

<p>When Count Zeppelin died in 1917 his assistants were placed under
obligations to carry on the work and administer the Zeppelin Endowment
according to the original terms which do not limit its activities
to national boundaries, but encourage the development of aerial
navigation throughout the world.</p>


<h3>Early Development and Flights</h3>

<p>Commencing in 1908 Zeppelin devoted his energies to perfecting
aircraft. There were many epoch making achievements, not only
the record flights and increasing efficiency and performance tests
but continuous discoveries and inventions no less important and
significant because they were for the time being accomplished within
the walls of laboratory and factory. They constitute one of the
most remarkable chapters in this age of mechanics and engineering,
and are worthy of further explanation later on.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p class="tit"><a name="PLATE_12" id="PLATE_12"></a>PLATE 12</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="images/plate12.jpg"><img src="images/plate12_th.jpg"
alt="Route of the Zeppelin L-59" title="Route of the Zeppelin L-59" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">Route of the Zeppelin L-59</p></div>

<p>One of the first flights, under the new organization, was that of
the new Zeppelin Z-1, April 1st, 1909, from Lake Constance to
Munich. Before it could land at Munich a heavy southwest wind
pushed it back from the field over which it hovered. The Commander
decided to “weather the storm” in the air; and for the first
time in the history of aerial navigation the airship remained aloft,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
her nose against the wind, her motors turning over just enough to
keep her in the same spot. Eleven hours later the Z-1 was still up
but shortly afterward signalled that she was being forced to land
because her fuel supply was becoming exhausted. Soldiers detailed
for the purpose assisted in mooring her fast in a field near Loiching,
where guarded by hundreds she lay all night in the storm, unharmed,
though repeatedly assailed by squalls which often swept against her
with 40 miles per hour (18 meters per second) velocity. The next
day she went up and hopped over to Munich and received a wildly
enthusiastic greeting from the thousands who had followed her
adventure with personal pride and interest. The Z-1 spent four
hours flying over Munich and then turned on her heels and back to
her harbor at Friedrichshafen. If there was anything necessary to
silence the few critics who still entertained doubts as to the ultimate
practicability of rigid airships, that flight of the Z-1 accomplished
the purpose.</p>

<p>Count Zeppelin meanwhile was rebuilding his “Echterdingen”
airship and on May 29th, 1909, he took it out of Manzell toward the
north of Germany. He kept on until he reached Bitterfeld before
turning back toward Lake Constance. After 38 hours in the air
during which he had traversed 683.5 miles (1100 kilometers) he
landed at Göppingen for gasoline. In landing the ship struck a
tree but the damage was quickly repaired and the rigid was able to
return under its own power to the air harbor on Lake Constance.</p>


<h3>Hailed as National Hero</h3>

<p>After a thorough overhauling Count Zeppelin flew the same airship
to Berlin, at the express invitation of the Kaiser, who gave a
dinner in his honor at the Royal Palace following an enthusiastic
popular reception from the entire populace in the capital. On his
return to Lake Constance he met severe storms and a broken propeller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
compelled a landing. It was found that a piece of the blade
had penetrated one of the gas bags; and three days were required to
repair the damage. Finally, after 27 hours in the air, the ship once
more rested in its home shed. It is said that this flight forever
established Zeppelin in the confidence of the people and the Government.
His ships acquired the reputation of the builder in being able
to surmount tremendous difficulties. The Zeppelin headquarters at
Friedrichshafen became the German Mecca. But the Germans were
not alone in their pilgrimage for thousands of persons interested in
aeronautics journeyed to Lake Constance on the shores of which
great plants had grown up on the land which Zeppelin had purchased
for his wonder city of the air.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1908 the members of the Reichstag and the Bundesrath
came to Friedrichshafen, a hundred or more trusting themselves
to the Zeppelin ship, the sole feature of the national celebration.
Thousands of watercraft dotted the clear waters of the lake as the
Zeppelin went up again and again filled to capacity with the leaders
of German political, financial, and industrial life (<a href="#PLATE_4">Plate 4</a>). Zeppelin
was hailed as a national hero, and more, for it was generally
recognized that his great vehicles possessing such speed and durability
were world travelers and as such would do much toward
bringing all parts of the world together and thereby eliminating
national borders—as far as trade, travel, and commerce were concerned,
at least.</p>


<h3>The New Construction Plant</h3>

<p>It was during the same year that Zeppelin abandoned the floating
shed at Manzell, where all his ships had been built. New work shops
were located on shore near Friedrichshafen (<a href="#PLATE_4">Plate 4</a>). Half of the
original contribution went into the new construction plant which was
incorporated as Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, <span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span> (the Zeppelin Airship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Building Co., Ltd.). Here the construction of the new Zeppelins
was begun with augmented forces of engineers and workmen.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p class="caption">Zeppelin “L-70” Naval Airship Entering Largest Shed at Friedrichshafen.
Winter of 1918.</p></div>

<p>Naturally the first airship was ordered by the Deutsche Luftschiffahrt
A.&nbsp;G. (“DELAG”)—the German Airship Transportation
Company—which had a paid in capital of 3,000,000 marks ($714,000.00)
subscribed by a number of public spirited men solely to start a
Zeppelin passenger and mail service. It was planned to employ
larger ships than those with which Zeppelin had convinced the
public, to secure greater lifting and carrying capacity. These ships
developed rapidly.</p>


<h3>Military Value Proved by Commercial Operation</h3>

<p>They attracted attention among the military authorities who had
decided that the Zeppelins offered advantages over the existing types
of observation aircraft, that they were in no way difficult to handle
in the air or on the ground and, in fact, were better adapted to
military purposes than others previously built. A deciding factor
in favor of the Zeppelins was the ease with which they could be put
into their sheds after each flight. The Government, accordingly,
ordered three airships built and equipped for military service. Their
performance was kept secret but they were accepted and obviously
performed equally as well as their contemporary commercial craft.</p>

<p>There was the Zeppelin “<b>Sachsen</b>” which flew to Vienna from
Baden-Baden in less than eight hours. This commercial flight led
the German army to buy three more military ships of the “<b>Sachsen</b>”
type.</p>


<h3>Activities Early in the War</h3>

<p>The Navy followed suit and in October, 1912, bought the L-1
(<a href="#PLATE_6">Plate 6</a>), for experimental and training purposes in connection with
the fleet. The L-1 carried 706,200 cubic feet (20,000 cubic meters)
of Hydrogen and proved its worth on its trial flight from Friedrichshafen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
thence north over Germany to Helgoland in the North Sea,
thence to the Baltic, side trips here and there, and finally to the
airship harbor at Johannisthal where it was to be stationed. The
flight lasted 34 hours.</p>

<p class="caption">Development of the Zeppelin from 1900 to 1919.</p></div>

<p>This persuaded the Naval officials that Zeppelins were essential
in marine warfare both for offense and defense. Another order was
placed, this time for a Zeppelin of much larger dimensions. It was
christened the L-2 and delivered in September, 1913 (<a href="#PLATE_6">Plate 6</a>).
This ship represented an utterly new departure in design, later
universally adopted. A corridor was built forming a keel on the
inside and bottom of the ship (<a href="#PLATE_7">Plate 7</a>). It had a gas capacity of
953,370 cubic feet (27,000 cubic meters) and was equipped with
four motors of 180 horsepower each.</p>

<p>Being the first of the kind it was inevitable that the corridor
arrangement should develop a flaw. It lacked proper ventilation.
Hydrogen leaked out from the ship and was drawn into the motor
gondolas. On one of its first flights this caused an explosion on the
L-2 which sent it to the ground a wreck.</p>


<h3>Operations with the Fleet</h3>

<p>Early in the spring of 1914 another Zeppelin, the L-3 (<a href="#PLATE_8">Plate 8</a>)
was delivered. It held 787,400 cubic feet (22,300 cubic meters) of
hydrogen and carried besides its own weight approximately 19,840
pounds (9,000 kilograms). The average speed was 43.5 miles (70 kilometers)
per hour with motors aggregating 630 horsepower. It
carried at least 6,614 pounds (3,000 kilograms) to a height of 9,186
feet (2,800 meters). The L-3 was the only naval airship Germany
possessed at the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>Following the ideas of the inventor both the German army and
navy used the Zeppelins for strategical reconnoissance in the early
days of the conflict. The Zeppelins flew the western and eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
boundaries of the empire seeking information concerning the movements
of the Allied armies. This proved dangerous, however, for
the airships then could not rise to high altitudes; and consequently
were exposed to enemy fire from the batteries below and airplanes
above.</p>

<p>The L-3 operated with the fleet in the North Sea and her activities
served to show the value of supplying as quickly as possible Zeppelins
able to fly high and with greater speed than ever. It was also
found advisable to cease flying over land by day. The Zeppelins
became the night cruisers of the air, and were assigned the task of
destroying railway junctions, bridges and ammunition dumps along
the enemy line of advance.</p>

<p>The Navy soon acquired the Zeppelins L-4, L-5, L-6 and L-7,
which joined the L-3 in the North Sea operations where they became
indispensable as the eyes of the fleet and a continual menace to the
enemy attempting to establish himself on the German Coast. All
these airships were duplicates of the L-3 except in minor details.
Their hulls long and cylindrical, of uniform cross sections, that is
excepting the ends each part was the same size as the others. This
was the first attempt at standard construction and it permitted
quantity production more economical and quicker for they were not
compelled to design and fabricate each section as it was needed.
The plant at Friedrichshafen had been expanded and was working
to capacity. Every effort was made to save time. The result was
remarkable for they were able to produce one Zeppelin every six
weeks. Late in 1914 the Zeppelin Z-11 was delivered to the army
and the L-8 to the navy.</p>


<h3>The Growth of the Zeppelins</h3>

<p>Larger sheds (<a href="#PLATE_8">Plates 8</a> and <a href="#PLATE_9">9</a>) were completed at Friedrichshafen
enabling Zeppelin to build bigger ships which could give the performances
he felt was essential.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p>The first of these, the LZ-38, left the shed in April, 1915, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
joined the army. It had 1,130,000 cubic feet (32,000 cubic meters)
of hydrogen capacity and was fuller, that is, its ratio of length to
diameter was 9 to 1 where in the former ships it was 11 to 1. The
wider girth afforded more freedom in design and the stern was
drawn out much finer, resulting in more speed; on later ships reaching
58.1 miles per hour (26 meters per second). The LZ-38 could
carry a useful load of 30,865 pounds (14,000 kilograms) besides her
own weight, more than 37% of her total lift. The Zeppelins of this
type (<a href="#PLATE_10">Plate 10</a>—LZ-77) proved from the day they were first flown equal
to all the demands made upon them.</p>


<h3>North Sea Patrol Flights</h3>

<p>They cruised over the North Sea scouting and guarding the
coastline, remaining in the air for thirty hours at a time. They flew
out from the western outlet of the Kiel Canal, northward along the
shores of Denmark to the Norwegian coast and thus were able
virtually to command the sea hundreds of miles around with powerful
glasses.</p>

<p>One day when the true details of the Skagerrak Naval Battle
are given to the world, it will realize the vital part which the Zeppelins
played. They consistently hampered the enemy’s mine laying
operations and rendered timely and valuable support to the counteractions
of the fleet. In discovering mines they were particularly
effective; and this work alone, about which the world was uninformed,
justified fully the time and labor put into their construction.</p>

<p>Ten Zeppelins of the L-38 type were delivered to the navy in
1915, numbered from L-10 to L-19 inclusively. Approximately as
many were turned over to the army during the year, each one being
slightly improved. Zeppelin and his staff of experts were always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
able to profit by the practical experience which the ships were undergoing
almost daily.</p>


<h3>Zeppelins Become Lighter and Stronger</h3>

<p>The hulls were strengthened and made more rigid, yet lighter,
machine guns were mounted at proper points of vantage and bomb
dropping apparatus so perfected that heavy loads of explosives could
be carried in absolute safety, yet instantly released and with remarkable
accuracy. An observation car was added to each new ship.</p>


<h3>The Zeppelin Observation Car</h3>

<p>This car was one of the most unique inventions developed during
the war. It could be lowered with an observer aboard, fully one
kilometer (3,280 feet) below the Zeppelin. Here the observer could
get his bearings while his ship lay far above hidden in the clouds.
The ship could fly or drift above the clouds to a point directly over the
spot to be bombed, then by lowering the car with the observer
through and just below the clouds, he was able to direct both the
operations of the ship and the bombing. A telephone connection
ran up through the supporting cable. He was able to signal for bomb
releases and navigate so efficiently that any objective could be
attacked without danger of the enemy seeing the Zeppelin lurking
behind the clouds.</p>

<p>Another Zeppelin, the L-20 was delivered to the navy early in
1916. It had hydrogen capacity of 1,271,160 cubic feet (36,000
cubic meters) though the diameter was the same as the others. The
L-20 carried a useful load of 37,478 pounds (17,000 kilograms), and
an increase of 1,312 feet (400 meters) over their ceiling and made
the same speed with the same horsepower.</p>

<p>During the year Zeppelin delivered seven more ships of this type,
but possessing greater efficiency. The navy received five of them
and the army two.</p>

<p class="caption">Maybach Airship Motor of 180 Horsepower, 1913.</p></div>


<h3>Anti-Aircraft Defenses Compel Zeppelins to Fly Higher</h3>

<p>The Allies meanwhile had developed anti-aircraft defenses and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their airplanes possessed greater climbing ability. To meet these
new conditions the airships were continuously compelled to fly
higher. They also required speed greater than the average of 54
miles per hour (25 meters per second) because while navigating over
the North Sea they frequently encountered winds of from 33.5 to
40 miles per hour (15 to 18 meters per second).</p>

<p>To meet these conditions the L-30 was built (<a href="#PLATE_9">Plate 9</a>). It had
a gas capacity of 1,942,000 cubic feet (55,000 cubic meters) and was
nearly twice as large as the original 1,129,920 cubic feet (32,000 cubic
meters) four motored ships. The L-30 was ready in May, 1916.
It was almost perfectly streamlined. The long cylindrical hull, so
convenient from a production standpoint, had been abandoned.
The L-30’s stern tapered gracefully to a fine point. It was driven
by six 240 horsepower Maybach motors, arranged practically as
before. One was located in the forward gondola with a direct drive
propeller, another three motors in the rear gondola, one with a
direct drive and two others each in a separate gondola located
opposite each other on the sides of the hull amidships, so as not to
interfere with the efficiency of the propeller in the rear gondola.
The L-30 carried 63,933 pounds (29,000 kilograms), about 45% of
its total lift. Other Zeppelins of her class had a useful lift of 50%
due to better design and superior materials. This represented a
marked advance, as the preceding types lifted only 37% of their
weight. The ceiling had been increased, too, by more than 3,280
feet (1,000 meters). They could now ascend from 11,800 to 14,750
feet (3,600 to 4,500 meters), depending on the load and weather
conditions. They made a speed of 63 miles per hour (28 meters
per second).</p>

<h3>Faster Zeppelins for Scouting</h3>

<p>These Zeppelins proved exceedingly valuable for scouting. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
were flown in all kinds of wind and weather. So great was their
capacity for fuel that there was no task too great for them to undertake.
But then, airplanes were constantly being improved, and
they could rise quickly to high altitudes. The planes carried machine
guns firing phosphorous incendiary bullets fatal to the hydrogen filled
hull of the Zeppelins if overtaken. Airplanes, naturally, could out-distance
airships, and there was no escaping them. The Zeppelins
were compelled to fly still higher than the L-30 type. There shortly
appeared other Zeppelins carrying loads of more than 39 tons or 60%
of the total lift of the ship; and they could fly at an altitude of 19,684
feet (6,000 meters) with 13,228 or 15,432 pounds (6,000 or 7,000 kilograms),
without depending on the thrust from the motors.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1917 “altitude” motors were developed, larger and
having supercompression. They did not develop full power at sea
level but instead functioned normally at 10,000 feet altitude above
sea level. They, moreover, gave ample power higher than that.
They speeded up the Zeppelins to 70.5 miles per hour (31.5 meters
per second).</p>

<p>The Zeppelin company built thirty-six ships of this type (<a href="#PLATE_10">Plate
10</a>-L43), from 1916 to 1918; and they were used by the army and
navy. The British R-34, which crossed the Atlantic in 1919, was
an exact duplicate of the Zeppelin L-30 type.</p>


<h3>Zeppelin Vision of World Transport</h3>

<p>Count Zeppelin was working on his post-war plans for commercial
aerial transport when he died in March, 1917. His latest ships had
demonstrated their worth as cargo carriers, not only in war but in
peace. Before hostilities commenced he had seen thousands of
passengers carried in his Zeppelins. An account of these operations
will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>.</p>

<h3>His Will Carried Out After His Death</h3>

<p>They had justified the inventor’s faith and inspiration. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
never abandoned his ideas of world transportation and was completing
a survey of requirements and conditions to be met when,
during a flight, he contracted inflammation of the lungs. Though
mortally ill and old in years—he was seventy-eight—Count Zeppelin
held conferences in his sick chamber, passing on to his assistants the
big idea of airship transportation. They have since continued the
work where Count Zeppelin left it. Following the funeral at Stuttgart
airships dropped garlands and wreaths of flowers on his grave,
in honor of the man who had done so much and had perfected an
organization capable of performing the tasks remaining.</p>


<h3>The Record Flight of L-59</h3>

<p>There is ample proof of what a modern Zeppelin can accomplish
when commercially operated and not forced to operate at the highest
possible altitude and maintain maximum speed. In November,
1917, the Zeppelin L-59 (<a href="#PLATE_11">Plate 11</a>) was sent to German East Africa
with medicines and ammunition for the beleaguered colonial troops.
The Zeppelin was especially prepared for the flight, all superfluous
equipment, such as bomb dropping apparatus and armament being
removed, all available space reserved for the cargo. The L-59 was
longer by 98.5 feet (30 meters) than the others. This made room
for two additional gas bags. Inside her 744½ foot hull (227 meters)
were 2,381,000 cubic feet (68,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen. She
could carry 50 tons easily. With only five motors she averaged 62.6
miles per hour (28 meters per second).</p>

<p>Flown from Germany to Jambol in Southern Bulgaria, the L-59
was there loaded with 9 tons of machine gun ammunition and 4 tons
of medical supplies and with 21 tons of gasoline for the motors.</p>

<h3>4225 Miles in Less than Four Days</h3>

<p>The great Zeppelin sailed out of Jambol (<a href="#PLATE_12">Plate 12</a>) at 9 o’clock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the morning, crossing northwestern Asia Minor, then the Aegian
Sea, south of Smyrna and on between the Islands of Crete and
Rhodes and across the Mediterranean, reaching the African Coast
by daybreak the next day.</p>

<p>The great Sahara Desert was then crossed, the L-59 passing over
the oasis of Farafrah and then Dakhla. Military headquarters at
Berlin, meanwhile, were trying to reach the Zeppelin by wireless.
The German Intelligence Office had intercepted a British wireless
message to the effect that the Colonial troops had surrendered to the
British. The L-59 had passed through a severe storm the night
before and had taken in her radio antenna; and it was not until she
was over Djebel Ain, west of Khartum that she listened in and picked
up the message. In a day and a half the L-59 had traversed 1865
miles (3,000 kilometers). Without stopping the Zeppelin was turned
about; and after retracing its path across the Sahara, thence over the
Mediterranean to Adalia on the coast of Asia Minor, and flying high
over Asia Minor and the Black Sea, arrived back in Jambol in less
than four days from the time it set out from that port. There
remained sufficient fuel aboard for two or three days additional
flying. The ship, under the same conditions, could have flown from
Hamburg to Khartum and return. As it was she traveled 4,225
miles (6,800 kilometers) on a non-stop flight which, though it occurred
in 1917, today remains the world’s record for all kinds of
aircraft, airship or airplane.</p>


<h3>Larger Zeppelins More Powerful</h3>

<p>During the summer of 1918 the Zeppelins were again given higher
climbing ability to meet the ever-increasing efficiency of planes and
anti-aircraft guns. Another gas bag was added to the new ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
(<a href="#PLATE_13">Plates 13</a> and <a href="#PLATE_14">14</a>), which brought them up to 2,189,220 cubic feet
(62,000 cubic meters) capacity. In order not to diminish the speed
two motors were added in respective gondolas, making seven engines
in all, aggregating 1820 horsepower. They could carry 94,798
pounds (43,000 kilograms) or about 60% of their total lift. It was
planned to add improvements enabling them to reach an altitude of
26,240 feet (8,000 meters) but the armistice halted all military
activities and there was no occasion at that time for commercial
craft to fly so high.</p>


<h3>The Most Remarkable Scientific Development in the History of
Aeronautics</h3>

<p>Looking back over the development of the Zeppelins (<a href="#PLATE_15">Plate
15</a>), one fails to find such remarkable and quick advance in any
other medium of transportation. The history of engineering does
not record in any other science progress comparable to that of the
relatively new science of lighter-than-air as represented by the
Zeppelins during the four years of war.</p>


<h3>Seventy Percent Speed Increase</h3>

<p>Their speed had increased from 46.6 to 87.5 miles per hour (75
to 130 kilometers per hour) approximately 70%. Their horsepower
averaged 2,000. To carry useful loads of 44 tons their hydrogen
capacity had been raised from 706,200 to 2,189,220 cubic feet (20,000
to 62,000 cubic meters). Other commercial ships were built embodying
the improvements developed during the war. A description of
them will be found in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>.</p>


<h3>Refinement in Design</h3>

<p>This progress was made possible only by continuous experiments.
Ideas and suggestions were adopted regardless of expense or chance
of failure. In this way the Zeppelins had the advantage of every
conceivable refinement in design. Their hulls, motor gondolas, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
fact, all braces and wires were streamlined so as to offer the least air
resistance.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p>The rubberized cloth gas cells, or bags, used in 1914 had been discarded
for others of light yet strong cotton cloth (and often silk),
lined with goldbeater’s skin to make them hydrogen proof.</p>

<p>Many of the experiments were as costly as they were painstaking
but the Zeppelin engineers had learned early in their work that airships
can not be built satisfactorily without long and arduous experiments
to support each innovation. By continually striving to increase
efficiency they secured simplified control systems and ships
that handled more easily, hulls that were far more rigid yet lighter
than their predecessors. Even the framework was lightened as by
degrees it was made stronger. Many structural parts were standardized,
facilitating production and repairs.</p>

<p>One has an idea of the innumerable parts necessary in the skeleton
of a Zeppelin when he learns that more than 250,000 small crossties
are required in making the triangular shaped girders in the frame
work of a 1,977,300 cubic foot (56,000 cubic meters) ship which
crosstie is a masterpiece of construction, because of its ingenious
shape and finish.</p>


<h3>Eighty-Eight Zeppelins During the War</h3>

<h3>One Hundred and Fifteen Zeppelins Built and Operated</h3>

<p>From the day Count Zeppelin built his first ship until the last in
1919, a total of 115 Zeppelins were built and operated. The first
three were experimental. Nine Zeppelins were successfully operated
commercially in the transportation of passengers. Forty were delivered
to the German army and 63 to the navy.</p>


<h3>Scientific Comparison</h3>

<p>There exists in the field of engineering an impartial, positive and
unswerving means of determining the relative merits of things; and
that is by a technical analysis of their success. By it one may
recognize the values of the principles and construction methods involved.
It is commonly said that nothing succeeds like success;
and this is virtually true of the Zeppelins. Their record for efficiency
remains unsurpassed, as a matter of fact, unequalled. It has never
been denied that they were superior to contemporary craft or that
they failed to maintain an increasing advantage over them.</p>

<p>This comparison is justified by the following figures which we will
first attempt to explain.</p>

<p>It will be noted that there are three kinds of efficiency, (1) Speed
(the aerodynamical figure), (2) Lift (the constructional figure) and
(3) All-around efficiency (the combined quality figure).</p>

<p>The first relates to the efficiency of airship propulsion as effected
by degrees of refinement in form, lessening of resistance, conservation
of power, etc. It is simply the relation between the speed and
engine power. Inasmuch as higher speed with the same power or
the same speed with less power means economy of operation; therefore,
the higher figure indicates superior quality.</p>

<p>Secondly, referring to the lift, this constructional figure indicates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the relative useful or pay loads carried with the smallest amount of
material used in the ship itself, because the ship, which must also be
carried is “dead weight.” As we must consider all ships equal as
far as structural safety is concerned, the technical performance is
determined by judging the relative performance in carrying useful
loads (for ships of similar size), or equal loads with smaller ships,
which means economy of operation. The higher figure indicates
superior quality. It should be noted that this constructional figure
is applicable only to comparison of airships of similar size, speed and
service requirements. For general comparison, however, ships of
approximately the same size may be considered.</p>

<p>Thirdly, all-around efficiency (the combined quality figure) is
somewhat arbitrarily chosen by considering both the speed and
carrying qualities together. It is not based on scientific deduction,
but rather is a practical means of estimating general worth,
as speed and carrying capacity are the main requirements of an
airship.</p>

<h3>The Zeppelin Organization at the Time of Its Greatest Activity
1918-1919</h3>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Zeppelin Endowment for the Propagation of Air Navigation
(Zeppelinstiftung zur Foerderung der Luftfahrt) which
Count Zeppelin founded with the subscription fund of
6,000,000 marks presented to him by the German people in 1908, is
administered by a Board of Directors, of which Baron Max Freiherr
von Gemmingen, Zeppelin’s nephew, who worked with him from
the start, is Chairman. The other Directors are Baron von Bassus
and Dr. Hugo Eckener.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin Endowment owns Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin (Zeppelin
Airship Building Co.), the construction company organized in 1908
and controls the “DELAG” organized, as stated before, in 1910 for
the operation of commercial Zeppelins. Interested in the “DELAG”
are a number of financiers, though with all the others, it was under
the personal supervision of Count Zeppelin, and after him the
Directorate of the Zeppelin Endowment.</p>

<p>At the time of the Armistice the construction and operating companies
employed 1,600 persons on their executive and engineering
staffs and 12,000 workmen.</p>

<p>Many subsidiary companies were organized and operated, specializing
in the various branches of Zeppelin work, experimenting and
producing.</p>


<h3>Many Subsidiary Companies</h3>

</div>

<p>These subsidiary companies are also controlled by the Directorate.
They were not permitted to disintegrate during the difficult period
following the war, but instead, have kept their personnel and facilities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
intact and are ready to continue the work which was interrupted
by the terms of the treaty. They produce respectively motors, gas
bags, propellers, gears, sheds and, in fact, everything pertaining to
aerial navigation including airplanes, flying boats and parts.</p>


<h3>The Construction Plants</h3>

<p>The great construction plants are organized on the same principles
as ship yards. Over them all is the General Director, Mr.
Alfred Colsman, and Chief Engineer, Dr. Ing. Ludwig Dürr, the
latter having been with Count Zeppelin since the first airship was
started and to whom much of the credit must be given for the success
attained.</p>

<p>There are various departments including the planning and supervising
divisions, two designing divisions (one for scientific and
general design, the other for workship and drawings), the manufacturing
and erecting divisions, calculating and accounting, testing
and controlling, and general maintenance divisions. The research
department is a separate organization.</p>


<h3>The Airship Factories</h3>

<p>In the airship factories the framework is made and erected. The
envelope is prepared, passenger and engine gondolas completed and
assembled along with other apparatus and instruments. The power
plant is built, excepting the motors and parts of the gear work.
Research work along the lines of airship development is conducted
there.</p>

<p>The original plant built at Friedrichshafen in 1910 included a
double shed, workshops, offices and laboratory buildings. The shed
would not accommodate ships of greater diameter than 52½ feet (16
meters), so in 1914 new workshops and another shed was built, to be
followed the next year by a still larger shed.</p>

<p>During 1915 and 1916 better workshops (<a href="#PLATE_16">Plate 16</a>), offices and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
larger laboratory, together with the largest wind tunnel on earth
were completed, along with a low pressure chamber for testing
motors, a new development as unique as it was important to the
automotive science.</p>


<h3>The Hydrogen Plant</h3>

<p>The original hydrogen plant was enlarged to a capacity output of
353,100 cubic feet (10,000 cubic meters) daily, with storage facilities
for 2,118,600 cubic feet (60,000 cubic meters). Since the war, the
storage facilities have been reduced to 706,200 cubic feet (20,000
cubic meters) by order of the Allied Commission.</p>


<h3>Powerful Radio Station</h3>

<p>The Zeppelin wireless plant, started in 1910, has continued to
develop with the science of radio and is now able to communicate
with the United States.</p>

<p>The duralumin factory is capable of meeting all Zeppelin requirements.</p>


<h3>The Great Zeppelin Hangars</h3>

<p>The original shed, built in 1908-09 and first used in 1910, is now
the ring building factory, where the great transverse frames for the
Zeppelins are made. It is 603½ feet (184 meters) long, 150.8 feet
(46 meters) wide and stands 65.6 feet (20 meters) high—huge dimensions
in the early days but utterly dwarfed by the great sheds which
have since appeared alongside. There are double doors at each
end, one set operated on the turning, the other on the sliding principle.
They are opened and closed by electricity in a few minutes.</p>

<p>In this shed twenty-eight Zeppelins were assembled, the last
being LZ-39 after which it was devoted to the transverse ring frames.</p>

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Victoria Louise”, 1912.</p></div>

<p>Twenty Zeppelins were built in the new shed, number one (<a href="#PLATE_16">Plate
16</a>), which is 629.8 feet (192 meters) long, 129.23 feet (39.4 meters)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wide and 91.8 feet (28 meters) high. Its double sliding doors are
electrically operated.</p>

<p>Six of the larger Zeppelins were either built or reconstructed in
another new shed, number two, erected to accommodate ships of
1,942,050 cubic feet (55,000 cubic meters) and more. It is 787.2
feet (240 meters) long, 150.8 feet (46 meters) wide and 114.8 feet
(35 meters) high. Its sliding doors can be opened or closed within
fifteen minutes. Both of the large sheds have long docking rails at
each end which enables the Zeppelins to leave or return to shelter
within a few minutes.</p>

<p>Another shed near the works at Loewental was turned over to
Zeppelin by the Government. The Navy Zeppelin L-11 was built
there in 1915. The last one was the navy ship L-72 which was
completed as the armistice was signed. It was not inflated for
delivery; and, therefore, remained the property of the Zeppelin
Company.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1919 the L-72 was outfitted for a demonstration
flight from Berlin to the United States and return; but it was prevented
by the Allied Commissions which ordered it to be kept in the
shed until delivered to France. All the Zeppelins assembled at
Loewental were fabricated at the main plant and taken there only
for final assembling of the parts.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin plant at Potsdam was erected in 1912 as an
airship harbor and the following winter became one of the main
construction centers with shed, workshops, and other necessary
equipment. Here the passenger Zeppelin “<b>Sachsen</b>” was lengthened
early in 1914. The last of the sixteen ships built there was the army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Zeppelin LZ-81 late in 1916, after which, because the shed was too
small for the larger ships, it was used for building giant seaplanes.
Later on it was converted into a special repair factory of all the
airship motors. The airship personnel was transferred to the
Staaken plant near Berlin.</p>


<h3>The Colossal Staaken Plant</h3>

<p>The Zeppelin-Staaken plant (<a href="#PLATE_17">Plate 17</a>), located in the outskirts
of Berlin is considered the most modern airship factory in the world.</p>

<p>Into it were put all the knowledge and experience of ten years of
practical airship production. There were at one time two large
sheds 820 feet (250 meters) long, 150.8 feet (46 meters) wide and
114.8 feet (35 meters) high, with a ring building shed between them,
great workshops, research laboratories, administration building,
hydrogen plant and all accessories.</p>

<p>The latest and most efficient machinery and tools then devised
were provided. A large airdrome was constructed, as it was planned
to make Staaken the post-war center of Zeppelin airship activity.</p>

<p>Here it was planned to locate both stationary and rotary sheds,
the latter turning like a locomotive turn-table, making it possible to
point their entrances in any direction the prevailing wind might
dictate, to insure safe launching or landing of the Zeppelins. Then
there were to be airplane factories on the same airdrome. It was
at the Staaken plant that the L-59 was fabricated for the record
flight to German East Africa and return. In all, twelve Zeppelins
were built there.</p>


<h3>The Duralumin Works</h3>

<p>During the war two plants were put up in the vicinity of Friedrichshafen
for making duralumin materials such as angle bars,
strips, all kinds of girders, and other parts of the Zeppelin skeleton.
They were operated for the most part with female labor.</p>

<h3>The Woodworking Factory</h3>

<p>A woodworking factory (Holzindustrie <span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span>-Meckenbeuren)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
also was established near Friedrichshafen for the manufacture of
propellers, etc. It has recently been enlarged and is operating at
full capacity producing materials for buildings, dwellings, etc.
During the war the specially designed Zeppelin propellers were made
at Göppingen.</p>


<h3>The Maybach Motor Works</h3>

<p>One of the accessory companies founded by Zeppelin in 1909
was the Maybach Motor Factory (Maybach-Motorenbau) (<a href="#PLATE_18">Plate
18</a>), at Friedrichshafen. It was enlarged considerably during the
war, supplying practically all the airship motors used. Today the
Maybach works include three large three story factory buildings,
parts of which are devoted to executive offices, two workshops of
recent origin occupying two acres, many engine testing stands,
laboratory, and a power plant fully equipped with the latest machinery.
The entire plant is under the management of Mr. Maybach,
inventor of the only motor designed for airships alone. One
reason for the peculiar efficiency of the plant is the special workman’s
training department which has received considerable attention
from the executives.</p>

<p>The first Maybach motors were produced in 1912 (<a href="#PLATE_19">Plate 19</a>),
and were 140 and 180 horsepower. They contributed largely to the
success of the commercial Zeppelin before the war. In 1915 a 240
horsepower motor was built, and this was the principal motor used
on the military and naval Zeppelins. Maybach produced an entirely
new motor in 1917. It supplied from 260 to 320 horsepower and is
noted as the first supercompression motor. Quickly recognized as
the best engine for airplanes, it became the leading German aviation
motor until late in 1918 when other motors built on similar principles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
appeared and were found more adaptable to the planes. Maybach,
meanwhile, developed other types (<a href="#PLATE_20">Plate 20</a>), principally 160
and 260 horsepower units for heavier-than-air craft.</p>

<p>The following table illustrates the development in types and performance
of engines:</p>

<h3>The Employment and Training System</h3>

<p>Apprentices and girls are given a thorough examination and test
to determine their fitness for the work, which requires the utmost
accuracy. Then they enter a twelve weeks probationary service.
Their apprenticeship lasts four years. All apprentices are given
instruction by engineers and foremen in physics, chemistry, knowledge
of materials, model making, foundry work, algebraic calculation
methods, the handling of graphics, curves, statistics, price calculation,
machines and tools and particularly the principles and
functions of internal combustion engines.</p>

<p>On January 1st, 1918, 1980 workmen were employed, 416 of
them women. There were 57 women on the executive and office
staff of 217. On November 1st, that year, 3300 workmen and 349
others were employed, 599 of them women.</p>

<h3>The Zeppelin-Maybach Gearless Car</h3>

<p>In the fall of 1921 Maybach exhibited for the first time the 22-70<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
horsepower gearless motor car, designed to simplify operation. Only
what is termed the direct speed is used in driving; except for grades
of more than 10%, and for the starting on these grades, when apart
from the rest of the mechanism a single gear is used by pushing down
a pedal. When it is released, the direct grip is automatically restored
without noise or vibration. Backing is accomplished with the electric
starting motor by means of a pedal. Smaller cars of this type
are now under construction.</p>


<h3>New Methods of Gas Bag Fabrication</h3>

<p>The early gas bags for the Zeppelins were made of rubberized
cotton fabric. This material was comparatively heavy and further,
it allowed the hydrogen gas to deteriorate during prolonged operations.
Count Zeppelin experimented with various materials, particularly
goldbeater skins, which are the big intestines of oxen and
other cattle, treated until they become like leather and then they
are very thin, tough and so durable that they wear much longer than
fabric. Zeppelin learned that goldbeater’s skins held gas better,
also, and unlike rubberized fabric, practically eliminated the danger
of electrical sparks due to friction or tearing.</p>

<p>He organized the Gasbag Manufacturing Company (Ballon-Hüllen
<span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span>) at Tempelhof in 1912, to carry out this development
and goldbeater’s skins were used exclusively, as the loss of two
Zeppelins that year was traced directly to the balloon fabric in the
gas bags causing sparks which exploded the hydrogen. The ships
were the LZ-12 and the Schwaben, the former exploding during inflation
and the latter while moored at Dusseldorf.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p class="caption">“DELAG”—Zeppelin Harbor and Manufacturing Plant at Potsdam (near Berlin), 1915.</p></div>

<p>The goldbeater skins possessed certain disadvantages, however.
For one thing, they were difficult to handle because of their small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
size; so they were shingled on to thin cotton fabric. Since 1917 silk
has been used, the combination when prepared being so light and
thin as to be transparent. In fact, the Zeppelins hulls are themselves
nearly transparent, the fabric envelope and gas bags being so
thin that one can make out figures silhouetted on the opposite side
of the hull when it faces the light.</p>

<p>The Tempelhof factory, with Mr. Trenkmann as Manager, now
includes many buildings and workshops, several put up recently for
dyeing and treating fabrics. During the war a thousand persons
were employed. The gas bags used in all the German airships were
made there; and the factory working with another firm under a
patent license agreement, made a majority of the German observation
balloons.</p>


<h3>The Maag-Zeppelin Gear Works</h3>

<p>It was not long after the war started that Count Zeppelin had
difficulty in securing delivery of cog-wheels, etc. In 1915 he co-operated
with Mr. Maag, a Swiss engineer, in starting the Friedrichshafen
Cog-wheel and Gear Factory (Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen
<span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span>), another subsidiary (<a href="#PLATE_18">Plate 18</a>.). The plant is as
modern as they could make it. The buildings occupy three acres.
They include office buildings, workshops for hobbing, heat-treating,
grinding and polishing cog-wheels and the complete gear transmissions.
Aluminum castings are obtained from the foundry of the
parent company, Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin.</p>

<p>The gear works is equipped throughout with automatic machines
built on the Maag patents. His cog-wheel involves a new principle,
giving utmost safety and freedom from wear and noise. Specially
designed testing machines are used, guaranteeing precision of the
gear wheels.</p>

<p>During the war the company made all the gearing on the Zeppelins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and airplanes. The factory is now operating at full capacity,
employing 500 men, making motor car gears, transmissions, etc.
The manager is Dipl. Ing. Count von Soden.</p>


<h3>The Hangar Construction Company</h3>

<p>Back in 1913 a subsidiary was founded, first as a consulting
engineering concern; but soon thereafter it became the Zeppelin
Hangar Construction Company (Zeppelin Hallenbau <span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span>).
Through long practical experience it is prepared to build and equip
complete airship harbors and dock yards, prepare landing fields
and airdromes. One of the principal developments with which it
has been accredited is the rotary shed, single or double. It has
erected special workshops, gas plants and all the accessories of a
modern flying terminal.</p>

<p>The company designed and constructed the two modern sheds at
Friedrichshafen, the entire Staaken plant, the “DELAG” airship
harbors and nearly all the other airports in Germany. Many
hangars and workshops in Germany today were put up by the company
using specially patented construction methods. In all some
twenty-four complete airship harbors have been built from start to
finish by this organization, which is under the management of Mr.
Milatz and his staff of experts varying between 20 and a hundred
members.</p>


<h3>Zeppelin Production of Airplanes</h3>

<p>In 1916, the airship building personnel conducted experiments
with airplanes made of airship duralumin girders covered with
fabric. The object was to secure a plane which would meet the
technical requirements of aerial photography. Though their activities
were devoted to the airship building programme, the engineers
managed to produce an experimental machine of that type. On its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
first trials, it proved so superior to existing types that the army
urgently requested early delivery of a number of machines. There
was little time to do the work, however, and at the end of the war
only twenty had been completed. They were destroyed, afterward,
under the terms of the Versailles treaty.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p class="caption">“DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee”.</p></div>

<p>There were other airplane enterprises organized by Count Zeppelin,
which remain today leaders in their respective fields. Zeppelin
was the first person to conceive of the giant all-metal flying boats
(<a href="#PLATE_21">Plates 21</a> and <a href="#PLATE_22">22</a>), and all-metal airplanes.</p>


<h3>The Zeppelin-Dornier Metal Monoplanes</h3>

<p>He organized a small group within the parent company, Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin,
in 1912. It was the first concern exclusively
engaged in all-metal airplane construction. Today the great plant
of Dornier Metallbau <span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span> at Seemoos, near Friedrichshafen
is noted the world over for its remarkable development in heavier-than-air
craft, which are named Dornier, after the manager and
chief engineer. From the first Count Zeppelin placed at the disposal
of Claude Dornier ample funds with which he was able to
follow utterly new and original methods in developing all-metal
planes on a strictly scientific basis.</p>

<p>It had never been done before. The plant in six years developed
from a small experimental workshop to one of the largest in the
world. At Seemoos there are located a great hangar, office buildings,
workshops, turntables, slips and other facilities for landing and
withdrawing the huge Dornier flying boats. Another great factory
was erected at Lindau in 1918 but has not been used for reasons of
economy.</p>

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Nordstern.”<br />

<p>As progress was made in designing, constructing and testing
metal planes, Dornier devoted the work practically toward perfection
of internally braced monoplanes. The monoplane principle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was maintained from the beginning. Today it is recognized generally
as the most desirable type. New designs, methods of handling
metal, experiments with various kinds of construction, newly invented
machine tools, experimental planes and models, each an
advance in efficiency, invariably something newly discovered in the
infant science of aerodynamics—these were the activities of Dornier
and his staff in six years.</p>

<p>The results were Dornier’s all-metal planes, possessing from 55
to 2,400 horsepower. They had just started quantity production of
big planes and flying boats in the factories at Lindau and Seemoos
when the German revolution halted all activities. Since then,
though hampered by the treaty stipulations, the company has developed
a series of commercial types unexcelled in construction,
performance and safe operation. Since the war both commercial
land planes and flying boats powered with from one to three engines
have been produced.</p>


<h3>Twenty-one Dornier Designs</h3>

<p>During the war their products included pursuit planes, single
motor two-place fighters (<a href="#PLATE_23">Plate 23</a>), two and three motored bombing
planes and four and multi-engined giant planes—all for over land
flying. Seaplane types included single engine two-place fighters,
two and three motored flying boats and four and multi-engine giant
flying boats. More than one hundred domestic patents were held
and more than 250 filed in foreign patent offices. Twenty-one different
designs for experimental types had been produced, seventeen
of them worked out in as many machines which were flown, and
four <a href="#PLATE_24">Plates 24</a>-<a href="#PLATE_25">25</a>-<a href="#PLATE_26">26</a>-<a href="#PLATE_27">27</a> made into models <a href="#PLATE_24">Plates 24</a>-<a href="#PLATE_25">25</a>-<a href="#PLATE_26">26</a>-<a href="#PLATE_27">27</a>. The

<h3>Zeppelin Builds Giant Airplanes</h3>

<p>But there was another angle to the Zeppelin airplane activities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Count Zeppelin held the rank of General in the German Army. He
had long been in a position which kept him informed of the needs
of the fighting forces. For several months after the declaration of
war he observed the heavy tasks to which his airships were put and
then undertook the development of larger airplanes, far larger than
any existing in the world at the time.</p>

<p>He consulted the noted aviator Hellmuth Hirth, and together
they conferred with Professor Baumann of the technical university
at Stuttgart. Baumann was already noted for his work as an aeronautical
engineer. Within a few months they produced a multi-engined
giant bomber. It proved successful. To produce these
machines in quantity the Zeppelin works at Staaken were erected
at the same time as the airship building plant. The airplane factory
at Staaken soon employed more than a thousand men in
turning out the giant night bombers, numbers of which were flown
in the raids over London and Paris in 1917 and 1918.</p>


<h3>The Airplane Works at Staaken</h3>

<p>The plant at Staaken was complete, including two great airplane
assembling sheds, workshops, offices, etc. It is now closed. Other
German firms have built similar bombing planes under the Zeppelin
patents. Twenty-six of them were built at Staaken, however.</p>

<p>They had a 137.76 foot (42 meters) wing span, carried 4.5 tons
useful load, could climb to a height of 14,760 feet (4,500 meters)
with their motors which aggregated 1,250 horsepower. Their average
speed was 90 miles per hour (<a href="#PLATE_23">Plate 23</a>).</p>

<div class="plate">

<p>Other machines were built, smaller, but of all-metal construction.
After the war “The Staaken Giant” (<a href="#PLATE_24">Plate 24</a>) was put into
commission. It, too, was all-metal, carried four motors and was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
distinctly a commercial plane. During many successful trials it
carried eighteen passengers at a speed of 145 miles an hour. Later
on, a two-engine commercial land plane was nearing completion when
the Inter-allied Aeronautical Commission ordered all work stopped,
and the activities at Staaken ceased.</p>


<h3>Social Welfare Institutions of the Zeppelin Organizations</h3>

<p>One of the main requisites for success in any industry is the welfare
of the men and women employed; and the establishment of the
great Zeppelin organization created a community of employees in the
small town on Lake Constance which demanded increasing attention
as the organization expanded.</p>

<p>At first questions of industrial and social welfare were settled by
a special department within Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, but in September,
1913, a separate organization (Zeppelin Wohlfahrt <span class="smcap">G.m.b.H.</span>) was
provided. Count Zeppelin specified that homes for the men be provided
immediately; that they should be built “economically but
that they should make for comfort.” One hundred and one single
family houses were completed in July, 1916, and the new community
was named Zeppelindorf (Zeppelin village) (<a href="#PLATE_29">Plate 29</a>). Each house
sits in a garden which enables the occupant to raise his own vegetables
and fruits.</p>

<p>The club house was opened in March, 1917. Here is a large
dining room for the workmen, which is also used for concerts, plays,
meetings and other social activities. There are several club rooms.
Nearby are the laundry, ice plant, steam plant, and other common
utilities. The “Inn” and general store are also patronized by the
people of Friedrichshafen.</p>

<p>Later an agricultural department was established for the purpose
of supplying good food at low prices. Five large farms are worked
by this branch and cattle raising and fruit growing have made it one
of the most notable institutions in Central Europe.</p>

has been created for the Zeppelin workers at Staaken, on the outskirts
of Berlin.</p>

<h3>Operations of Commercial Zeppelins</h3>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ttracted</span> by Count Zeppelin’s earlier flights, hundreds
of persons made reservations for the regularly conducted
commercial trips, when in 1910 he organized the Deutsche
Luftschiffahrt, A.&nbsp;G. (German Air Ship Transportation Co.), briefly
called the “DELAG”. There was apparently a popular demand
for commercial airship transport. Zeppelin founded the “DELAG”
to meet this demand, and also to provide operating personnel and
train pilots and crews for the other services, which he knew, would
be necessary in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The “DELAG” was capitalized for 3,000,000 marks (approximately
$714,000) and while it was a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin,
there also participated in this commercial operating organization
a number of capitalists, whose faith in commercial air transport
was fully justified by the success of the “DELAG” despite
much difficulty the first year or so due to lack of meteorological data
and inexperience.</p>


<h3>The First Air Transport Company</h3>

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee.”<br />

<p>During the latter part of 1910, minor accidents occurred which
sometimes damaged the airships and disrupted the service, but in
1911 a comparatively regular service was established and maintained.
The principal ship was the “<b>Schwaben</b>,” (<a href="#PLATE_5">Plates 5</a> and <a href="#PLATE_30">30</a>) which was
far superior to her predecessors and which had the advantage of new
and larger sheds at the Zeppelin-“DELAG” airports. The schedule
maintained by the “<b>Schwaben</b>” justifies the assertion that the
“DELAG” operated the first commercial aerial transport company
on earth. Her success encouraged expansion, and in 1912, two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
additional ships, the “<b>Victoria Louise</b>” (<a href="#PLATE_31">Plates 31</a>-<a href="#PLATE_32">32</a>) and the
“<b>Hansa</b>” (<a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>) were built and entered the “DELAG”
service, to be followed the next year by the “<b>Sachsen</b>”, (<a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>).</p>


<h3>Part of the Aviation Reserve</h3>

<p>The German Army commandeered all these commercial Zeppelins
at the start of the war. They were used partly for military duty
and partly as training ships for the many necessary crews. The
first year of the war, they added hundreds of flights to the commercial
record they had already made; but gradually became obsolete and
were dismantled to make room for the newer and more efficient
types being turned out at the Zeppelin Plants.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the “DELAG” were at Frankfort. It was
from that city that the chief executives controlled operations. The
Business Manager had charge of the financial and commercial activities.
He supervised salaries, purchase of supplies, materials, etc.
Flying operations were in charge of a Director of Flight. He had
charge of the personnel at the air harbors; and all technical problems
were put up to him.</p>

<p>The crew of a commercial Zeppelin included the pilot, a reserve
pilot, a flight mechanic, helmsmen and engineers, the number depending
on the nature of the flight, a wireless operator and a ship’s steward.
The crew usually aggregated twelve men.</p>


<h3>Created the First Airship Harbor</h3>

<p>As far as practicable, each Zeppelin was assigned to a definite
air harbor, which was known as its home station, or terminal. Here
all the repairs and maintenance were done. The members of the
crew were assigned to suitable homes, all located in that immediate
vicinity. The maintenance crews for airships and sheds were also
stationed there. These auxiliaries averaged thirty persons under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
direction of a foreman. They, too, formed the nucleus for the landing
party necessary to handle the airships on arrival or departure. Each
air harbor had a manager and his assistants to handle business details.</p>

<p>When the Zeppelin arrived at its home port, and during its
sojourn there the pilot was in sole command of both ship and air
station. He was held strictly accountable for the safety of his ship;
and acted as both station master and flying officer, subject only to
instruction from the Director of Flight. The pilot alone made the
decisions as to whether or not he should make a flight, when he should
start and the number of passengers and crew he would carry. It is
interesting to note that this system was adopted for the entire
German airship force during the war. In fact, practically all airship
personnel was trained by the “DELAG.”</p>


<h3>Like Land and Water Services</h3>

<p>There was no special organization for selling passenger accommodations.
Agents of the Hamburg-American Line (“HAPAG”)
which had offices in all German cities, also represented Zeppelin,
and reservations were made on the same basis as for ocean going
vessels.</p>

<p>The “<b>Deutschland</b>” was the first Zeppelin operated by the
“DELAG.” The motors, however, were not very dependable; and
the low speed of the ship, combined with lack of experience made it
susceptible to minor accidents. The <b>Deutschland</b> was so badly
damaged, finally, that Zeppelin was compelled to rebuild her. During
the period that she was being reconstructed the Zeppelin LZ-6
was substituted.</p>


<h3>The “Schwaben” Filled all Requirements</h3>

<p>The first ship to fill the requirements essential to safe and steady
commercial operations was the “<b>Schwaben</b>” built in the summer of
1911. She was 459.2 feet (140 meters) long, 45.9 feet (14 meters) in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
diameter, and of 615,580 cubic feet (18,000 cubic meters) hydrogen
gas capacity. Her three Maybach 145 horsepower motors gave the
“<b>Schwaben</b>” a speed of 43 miles an hour (19.3 meters per second).
She had a useful lift of 8,818.4 pounds (4,000 kilograms).
During the latter part of 1911 more than a hundred flights were
made with the “<b>Schwaben</b>” between Lake Constance, Niederheim,
Gotha, and Berlin. These flights warranted larger ships.</p>

<div class="plate">

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Nordstern.”<br />

Interior view with gas bags removed.</p></div>

<p>In March 1912, the “DELAG” put into operation the new
Zeppelin “<b>Victoria Louise</b>” (<a href="#PLATE_31">Plates 31</a>-<a href="#PLATE_32">32</a>) and in the summer,
her sister ship the “<b>Hansa</b>”. These Zeppelins were 485.4 feet (148
meters) long and 45.9 feet (14 meters) in diameter. They each
held 670,890 cubic feet (19,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen and their
useful lift was 11,023 pounds (5,000 kilograms). Motors had been
so improved that the “<b>Victoria Louise</b>” and “<b>Hansa</b>” were
able to make 44.7 and 46.9 miles per hour respectively.</p>


<h3>Accommodations for Many Passengers</h3>

<p>Each Zeppelin accommodated twenty-four passengers besides the
crew. Warm meals were served from the up to date electrical
kitchen. There was wireless aboard, also.</p>

<p>The ships gave complete satisfaction during hundreds of flights
made over constantly increasing distances. They won the confidence
of the traveling public; and equally important, had supplied much
valuable experience and information, for they operated in all kinds
of weather at all seasons of the year.</p>

<p>In 1913, the new Zeppelin, “<b>Sachsen</b>”, (<a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>) was added to
the “DELAG” fleet. She had a length of 459.2 feet (140 meters)
and a diameter of 49.2 feet (15 meters) which increased the lift
because she carried 670,890 cubic feet (19,000 cubic meters) of hydrogen
which gave her a useful lift of more than 13,227.6 pounds
(6,000 kilograms). Her speed was better than 48 miles an hour and
she carried twenty-four passengers.</p>

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee.”<br />

<p>New and larger sheds were built for the “DELAG” as the fleet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
increased in size. When they first commenced flying there were
only two airship sheds in addition to the one at Friedrichshafen.
These were at Baden-Baden and at Dusseldorf. They owned the
shed at Baden-Baden and leased from the municipality the one at
Dusseldorf. Toward the end of 1911 others were available, one at
Johannisthal near Berlin and one at Gotha. In 1912 two more were
ready, one at Frankfort on the Main, owned by the “DELAG,” and
one at Potsdam, owned by Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin. In 1913 the
municipalities of Hamburg, Leipzig and Dresden erected sheds.
(<a href="#PLATE_34">Plates 34</a>-<a href="#PLATE_35">35</a>-<a href="#PLATE_36">36</a>.) In the beginning the sheds were single but the
ones built after the “DELAG” had started regular schedules,
accommodated two ships side by side. Some of the sheds were
huge, often 196.8 feet (60 meters) wide.</p>


<h3>Development of Adequate Hangars</h3>

<p>They were provided with electric lights, water supply and docking
rails, which extended from either end. Special piping conveyed the
hydrogen from plant to shed. All sheds had railway connections,
and were equipped with waiting rooms for passengers and crews,
as well as workshops and accessory buildings. The airship harbors
built by the “DELAG” and Zeppelin had particularly extensive
workshops, for besides the regular maintenance work, they produced
many new parts and instruments for navigating Zeppelins.</p>

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee.”<br />

<p>At every shed there was a meteorological station fitted with
barometers, barographs, thermographs, and a theodolite for measurement
of the wind velocity in the upper atmosphere. Weather
observations were made each morning and telegraphed to all other
stations. This enabled all Zeppelin pilots to be thoroughly informed
before setting out on a flight. The special data supplied by the
Zeppelin stations was more adequate for airship requirements than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that from the Government official weather bureau. Wireless equipment
was installed late in 1913.</p>


<h3>Many Long Commercial Flights</h3>

<p>The average commercial flight was from 37 to 62 miles (60 to 100
kilometers) from 1½ to 2½ hours. When the flights were from one
airship harbor to another they often lasted four and sometimes eight
hours. The fare was determined by the length of the flight, or the
mileage. Round trip flights, which were comparatively short, cost
from 25 to 50 dollars (one to two hundred marks.) The long distance
trips ranged from 60 to 150 dollars (250 to 600 marks). Many single
flights were made over the North Sea. The “<b>Victoria Louise</b>”
often flew to Helgoland, Sylt and Norderney, the “<b>Hansa</b>” to
Copenhagen and the “<b>Sachsen</b>” to Vienna. These flights were
characterized as pleasure trips; and as such none was undertaken
during the winter months. Instead, the Zeppelins underwent a
thorough overhauling. Sometimes, however, a Zeppelin was kept
in service all winter to train airship personnel of the army or navy.</p>

<p>Naturally “DELAG” became noted for its successful operations;
and its ships were repeatedly chartered by the military or naval
personnel for training flights.</p>


<h3>Developed Airship Navigation</h3>

<p>The “DELAG” has been credited with the entire development of
airship navigating technique. For one thing, it was the only organization
of its kind, training airship personnel in practical operations.
The “DELAG” airships and airship crews were used almost exclusively
for training purposes when war was declared. At that time
there were two other airship construction companies in Germany,
Schütte-Lanz and Parseval. Both of these organizations procured
their airship pilots from the trained personnel of the “DELAG.”</p>

<h3>Zeppelins Operated Safely</h3>

<p>All of the flights listed in the following table were made without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
a single injury to passengers or crew. The <b>Deutschland</b> had
been repeatedly damaged while entering or leaving her shed and was
rebuilt. The “<b>Schwaben</b>” was burned at her moorings during a
severe storm. It is now known that all these accidents could have
been avoided, in view of the progress that has been made in the
science of lighter-than-air. Experience has materially increased the
performance and qualities of safety in airships. Better motors, controls,
gas bags and other parts of the Zeppelin have been so improved
as to preclude possibility of accidents such as those which occasionally
hindered the operations of “DELAG” before the war. Each of
the flights listed here averaged two hours, 68 miles (109 kilometers),
traversed with 22 passengers. All the flights aggregated 107,180
miles (172,535 kilometers), more than <i>four times the girth of the earth</i>
at the equator.</p>

<h3>Trained Germany’s Airship Forces</h3>

<p>In the early days of the war the “<b>Victoria Louise</b>” made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
more than a thousand training flights for more than 39,852 miles
(64,152 kilometers) in 1292 hours, flying time, all after she had been
added to the military training forces. Finally, her framework became
so worn that she was dismantled. The “<b>Sachsen</b>” and
“<b>Hansa</b>” (<a href="#PLATE_33">Plate 33</a>) performed similar service.</p>

<p>From the Managing Director to the mechanics, all of the “DELAG”
personnel entered the service during the war, where they were instructors,
and it was due to them that the numbers of Zeppelins
launched for war service were manned by crews qualified to operate
them.</p>


<h3>Commercial Operations Resumed</h3>

<p>The real work for which the “DELAG” was created, “to develop
commercial air transport” was of necessity put aside during the
period of the war, but these activities were resumed early in 1919
when it was decided to start a regular daily passenger service, at
first between Berlin and Friedrichshafen, a distance of 373 miles
(600 kilometers) and afterward extend it to Switzerland, Italy, Spain
in the south and to Sweden in the north. The pre-war personnel of
the “DELAG” was assembled at Friedrichshafen and the route to
Berlin started by the new Zeppelin “<b>Bodensee</b>” on August 24th,
1919 (<a href="#PLATE_38">Plate 38</a>).</p>


<h3>The “Bodensee” an Improved Type</h3>

<p>The “<b>Bodensee</b>” was designed and built in six months (January
to July 1919), by Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin. She was the same
size as the pre-war Commercial Zeppelins, <i>but had twice the engine
power, carried twice their useful load and maintained a speed equal
with the former ships using only one-half of their engine power</i>.</p>

<div class="plate">

alt="Zeppelin Bodensee" title="Zeppelin Bodensee" /></a></p>

<p class="caption">20-30,000 Cubic Meter Fast Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee” Type.</p></div>

<p>The “<b>Bodensee</b>” was 426.4 feet (130 meters) long, after she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had been lengthened by 32.8 feet (10 meters). Her diameter was
61.3 feet (18.7 meters) and she carried 794,475 cubic feet (22,500 cubic
meters) of hydrogen. Her useful load normally was 25,353 pounds
(11,500 kilograms). Her four motors were of 260 horsepower each.
They turned three direct-driven propellers, one in each of the port
and starboard motor gondolas which hung from the sides of the ship.
The third propeller was driven by two engines in the rear motor
gondola. The propellers averaged from 1,300 to 1,400 revolutions
a minute. The “<b>Bodensee</b>” was capable of making 80 miles an
hour. Her cruising speed was 75 miles an hour.</p>


<h3>Carried Thirty Passengers</h3>

<p>At this pace she could carry thirty passengers comfortably. They
were seated in a luxurious salon (<a href="#PLATE_41">Plate 41</a>) built in the pilot car
under the forward part of the Zeppelin. Nearby in the same car
were a kitchen and lavatory.</p>

<p>The “<b>Bodensee</b>” was maintained on the Friedrichshafen-Berlin
route to experiment further in commercial air transport. While
the “DELAG” did not attempt to make a profit, expenses were kept
as low as possible and the prospects of monetary returns were generally
favorable.</p>


<h3>One Hundred and Three Flights in Ninety-Eight Days</h3>

<p>From August 24th until December 1st, 1919, the “<b>Bodensee</b>”
made 103 flights in 98 days; on several days making two flights, one
a short sightseeing trip over Berlin in addition to her regular run.
Seventy-eight flights were made between Lake Constance and Berlin
and two between Berlin and Stockholm, eighty trips on schedule in
ninety-eight days. There was no flying for ten days owing to general
overhaul and repairs. On three occasions the regular flights were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
postponed because of heavy cross winds which made it difficult and
dangerous to start the Zeppelin from the fixed shed of the airdrome
at Staaken. This meant the loss of six trips. Two of the regular
trips were omitted because of the flights to Sweden.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in that period 2,380 passengers were carried, exclusive
of crews, about 11,000 pounds (5,000 kilograms) of mail and
6,600 (300 kilograms) of express, freight and baggage. The
“<b>Bodensee</b>” was in the air 533 hours, flying in all 32,300 miles (52,000
kilometers) an average of 62 miles an hour. Notwithstanding the
many unforeseen difficulties due to uncertain political and economic
conditions in Germany during the last quarter of 1919, the technical
results of the “<b>Bodensee</b>” operations were excellent.</p>


<h3>The “Nordstern” a Sister Ship</h3>

<p>A sister ship of the “<b>Bodensee</b>” was built during the last
quarter of 1919, and named the “<b>Nordstern</b>” but in December,
that year, the Inter-Allied Air-Control Commission ordered the
airship operations stopped. The “<b>Bodensee</b>” was delivered to Italy
and the “<b>Nordstern</b>” to France in 1921.</p>

<p>Once more the aeronautical world became interested in Zeppelins.
The last cruise of the “<b>Bodensee</b>” under German management took
her from Friedrichshafen to Rome. She cruised over Zurich, Bern,
Geneva and Avignon, often making 160 kilometers an hour, to
the Mediterranean, near St. Rafael. Visitors at Cannes, Nice and
Monaco saw a rigid airship for the first time as the “<b>Bodensee</b>” held
to her route passing directly over Corsica and Elba, and finally to
the airdrome in Ciampino, between Rome and the Albanian mountains.
She had made more than 825 miles (1,329 kilometers) in 12
hours and 49 minutes, at an average speed of 64.6 miles (104 kilometers)
an hour for the entire distance.</p>

<h3>The Zeppelin Organization and Facilities Today</h3>

<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Zeppelin organization today is prepared to build, deliver
and operate rigid airships for any purpose. It has under
contract virtually all the competent airship personnel in
Germany. Practically all the engineering staffs and workmen
employed in developing Zeppelins have been retained, one way or
another, that they may be prepared to guarantee satisfactory performance
of any Zeppelin turned out.</p>

<p>Actual construction work was discontinued early in 1920. The
Allied Powers so interpreted the Treaty of Versailles that the German
aircraft industry was not able to produce ships or planes having the
least possible military value. Further restrictions were defined in
the London Ultimatum. They have been enforced by the Allied
Control Commission.</p>


<h3>Research and Development Work Continues</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding this severe handicap, the Zeppelin organizations
have been kept intact. There has been sufficient work on motor cars,
motor boats, motors, gears, aluminum foundry work, etc. to keep
the workmen occupied. Where some of the plants have been closed,
the entire personnel has been transferred into the other active organizations.
In each branch of the Zeppelin organization design and
research work on airships and aerial navigation have continued and
progressed.</p>


<h3>Zeppelin Able to Produce All Types</h3>

<p>Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin has been particularly active in developing
as far as possible the many ideas and inventions originating
before and during the war. Many of their new airship designs have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
been completed, others partly finished. It is now possible to produce
quickly any type of commercial airship from of 700,000 to 7,000,000
cubic feet (20,000 to 2,000,000 cubic meters) capacity.</p>

<p>Airships for national defense are available, such as scouting, long
distance patrol ships and others for mine spotting and short radius
patrol.</p>


<h3>Guaranteed Performance Based on Actual Experience</h3>

<p>From actual experience during the war Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin is
able to build and guarantee the performance of airplane carrying
airships which permit large or small planes being launched or taken
aboard while in flight.</p>

<p>Bombing and raiding airships have been developed; but on the
other hand the military development is considered of secondary
importance to the vast amount of knowledge and experience acquired
for commercial airship operations.</p>

<h3>Complete Airship Navigation Data Now Available</h3>

<p>The Zeppelin Operating Company (“DELAG”) have collaborated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in assembling all possible data relative to the operation and navigation
of the great rigids, with a view toward having it available for
immediate use and the instruction of other personnel when and
wherever circumstances permit or require.</p>

<p>Aerial transport requirements of the future have been the subject
of exhaustive study and research. Many new inventions have
resulted from this knowledge of what is necessary to realize even
part of the almost limitless possibilities in airship communication.
Innumerable ideas have been created and passed upon by experts
who have decided finally as to their practicability and financial worth.</p>

<p>The “DELAG,” which it will be noted, is the navigating company
of the Zeppelin organization, has retained all of its 1919 personnel
and has added to it such forces as the outlook for the future seems
to warrant. The “DELAG” has about all of the qualified airship
personnel in Central Europe.</p>


<h3>Zeppelin Organization Equipped for New Conditions</h3>

<p>The parent company, Luftschiffbau-Zeppelin, has so arranged its
organization that it can handle any development arising from the
new situation both politically and economically.</p>

<p>Heretofore the management was under Director-General Alfred
Colsman alone. Today it is divided into three divisions, operating,
constructing and financial. Mr. Colsman handles the financial
divisions and various subsidiary companies. Dr. Ludwig Dürr
the construction, and Dr. Hugo Eckener the operating division which
includes also the technical phases and all outside relations, domestic
and foreign. Dr. Eckener, meanwhile, retains his position as managing
Director of the “DELAG” and as one of the Directors of the
Zeppelin endowment.</p>

<p class="caption">135,000 Cubic Meter Fast Passenger Zeppelin—Stateroom.</p></div>

<p>Considered from all angles, due to the present development and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
knowledge of the science of lighter-than-air, it is possible today to
provide satisfactory airship service for any route contemplated or
which may be planned for the future.</p>


<h3>Two and a Half Days Trans-Atlantic Service Possible</h3>

<p>Carefully prepared calculations on some 600 flights made up and
carried out from daily weather maps of the north Atlantic on methodically
selected periods, have convinced the Zeppelin officials that a
two and a half day Zeppelin service could be maintained between
Europe and America.</p>

<p>Zeppelin engineers worked incessantly making the North Atlantic
flights across the weather maps. When they had completed their
600 theoretical trips they knew as much about what actually could
be done, as if they had flown such a service for two or three years.
With the exception of a few details, easily worked out in a brief
experimental period, the Zeppelin organization could put such a
service in operation at once, if permitted.</p>


<h3>New York-Chicago Route Difficult but Practicable</h3>

<p>There has been considerable speculation relative to the New
York-Chicago route. Several announcements have been made that
either an airplane or airship service was about to be started. The
Zeppelin engineers came to the United States not long ago and made
a preliminary survey of that route. They based their report on a
thorough examination of daily weather maps and reports for the last
thirty years and stated that a New York-Chicago route could be
operated successfully. It was pointed out that the New York-Chicago
line would assume more responsibility for the fair name of
commercial airship transport than anywhere on earth, more so, even
than the trans-atlantic route which, technically, is far less difficult.</p>

<p>When asked to cooperate in a New York-Chicago airship line,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the Zeppelin organization has consistently pointed out the many
problems to be met. Their preliminary survey shows that they can
maintain a twelve hour schedule, with almost 100% regularity in
summer, from 80 to 90% in winter, or an average yearly performance
of from 93 to 96%.</p>


<h3>Many Engineering Problems Solved</h3>

<p>In addition, the Zeppelin organization supports its conclusion
with a fund of engineering data. Considerable research work has
resulted in solving many problems including passenger accommodations
and the structure of larger airships, improvement of the gasoline
engine, the steam turbine and the Diesel engine. They have provided
for the safety of gas containers, eliminating fire and lightning
risk, even producing a nitrogen mantle.</p>

<p>Gearings, reversible propellers and modern methods of ballast
recovery have been perfected or improved.</p>

<p>Various devices for launching ships, rotary sheds accommodating
two giant Zeppelins yet revolving under light power from electric
motors, and many other docking facilities are primarily of Zeppelin
origin.</p>

<p>Zeppelin has also improved methods for fabricating all-metal
commercial planes.</p>


<h3>Zeppelin Now Aims to Increase Efficiency</h3>

<p class="caption">The “DELAG” Passenger Zeppelin “Bodensee.”<br />

<p>Many of the problems in commercial airship operations or design
will be solved shortly after actual operations are started. The aim
of Zeppelin engineers has been to increase the efficiency of the airship
as it has been proven that the financial returns from airship transport
are, or should be, proportionately increased by the use of larger
ships. The Zeppelin efforts, therefore, is to secure greater efficiency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which will allow better financial returns with smaller units and less
expense.</p>


<h3>Commercial Operations Data Compiled</h3>

<p>While this has been one of the principal objectives of the engineering
branch, the operating staffs have developed new methods of
handling the big ships commercially; improved organizations, and
methods and apparatus for making coast and geodetic surveys by
airship, forest fire patrol, and scientific explorations.</p>

<p>Their investigations of weather and technical conditions have
extended throughout the world; one of the principal surveys of
proposed routes being between Spain and Buenos Aires, in which it
was learned that a normal schedule can be maintained regularly
with ninety-six hours allotted for non-stop flights between the two
terminals.</p>


<h3>The Public will Accept Airship Transportation Here as Abroad</h3>

<p>Of course, the public must be converted to the use of the airship,
just as the people of Germany were converted—by actual operations.
There probably exists no other field of human endeavor so essential
to our civilization as that of transportation. The traveling public
has accepted other mediums of conveyance after they had demonstrated
inherent qualities of safety and reliability. So it is with
aircraft. Heavier-than-air machines have gradually popularized
flying. Persons are riding by the air route in constantly increasing
numbers, here and abroad. Their faith in commercial aviation is
due solely to the BRAVE pioneering efforts of a few men of vision
these last twenty years. Popularity and general use depends on the
efficiency of the organizations which now carry on the work so well
begun.</p>

<h3>Zeppelin Ready to Participate in Development Throughout the World</h3>

<p>It is the privilege of Zeppelin to participate in this development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
along the lines laid out by the founder, to the end that the rigid airship
may do its part in bringing men and nations more closely
together and facilitate mutual understanding and good will throughout
the world.</p>
